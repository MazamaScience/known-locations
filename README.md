# Known Locations

This repository contains _"known locations"_ files providing spatial metadata 
for monitoring sites used in air quality and other stationary, environmental 
monitoring activities.

These files are largely generated and maintained using the 
[MazamaLocationUtils](https://github.com/MazamaScience/MazamaLocationUtils)
R package.

Metadata generated with **MazamaLocationUtils** are manually corrected and 
further enhanced using R scripts in this repository.

The goal is to maintain a set of high-accuracy, high-value datasets that 
provides data analysts spatial metadata associated with point locations without 
having to use any spatial analysis software.
